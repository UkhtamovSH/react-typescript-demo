# Why TypeScript + React ?

With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you are typing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime
TypeScript – provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete
TypeScript – makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier

# You might say

- TypeScript is just frustrating most of the times
- I have to write a lot more code than I normally do and the compiler keeps complaining. I simply do not know what to do these errors
- It does not seem to be productive for me
